In this system, eight digits are used - from 0 to 7. Each digit indicates a certain number of units that correspond to its category. It is also sometimes used in digital technology.

To the binary system:
Each digit of the octal system is a block of three binary digits. For example, the digit 2 in the octal system is represented by the binary digits "010", 5 - "101", etc.
   To convert, we translate each digit in the octal number string into the corresponding block of binary digits.
   The final string of binary digits will be the result of conversion from octal to binary.
   345(8) = 011100101(2)

To the decimal system:
   - The digits of a number in the octal number system are multiplied by powers of 8 - from right to left.
   - For example, the number 245 in the octal system is converted to decimal as follows:
2*8^2 + 4*8^1 + 5*8^0 = 2*64 + 4*8 + 5*1 = 128 + 32 + 5 = 165.
   - The amount received will be a number in the decimal system numbers.
   345(8) = 3*8^2 + 4*8^1 + 5*8^0 = 3*64 + 4*8 + 5*1 = 192 + 32 + 5 = 229(10)

To the hexadecimal system:
   - Numbers in the octal number system are converted to the decimal system.
   - Next, the resulting decimal number is converted to the hexadecimal system by converting digits to the corresponding characters (0-9, A-F).
   345(8) = E5(16)
