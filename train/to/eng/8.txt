In this system, eight digits are used - from 0 to 7. Each digit indicates a certain number of units that correspond to its category. It is also sometimes used in digital technology.

Binary translation:
Divide a binary number into groups of 3 digits, starting from the right.
   If the last group contains less than 3 digits, add leading zeros.
   Then replace each group with the corresponding octal digit:
     - 000 = 0
     - 001 = 1
     - 010 = 2
     - 011 = 3
     - 100 = 4
     - 101 = 5
     - 110 = 6
     - 111 = 7
   Combine the resulting octal digits into one number and this will be the result.

Decimal translation:
   Divide the decimal number by 8.
   Write down the remainder of the division at the bottom.
   Divide the resulting quotient again by 8 and write down the new residuals at the bottom.
   Continue dividing by 8 and recording the remainder until the result of the division is 0.
   Reverse the remainder written at the bottom, and it will be an octal number.

Hexadecimal Translation:
First, convert a hexadecimal number to a binary number.
   Then convert the binary number to an octal number using the method described above for converting from binary to octal notation.

To convert to the octal system, division by 8 is used. The whole part is converted into octal form by sequentially dividing by 8 and writing down the remainder. The fractional part is translated by multiplying by 8 and writing the whole part of the result. 
The resulting numbers are combined and represent an octal representation of a real number.
