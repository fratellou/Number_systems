In this system, eight digits are used - from 0 to 7. Each digit indicates a certain number of units that correspond to its category. It is also sometimes used in digital technology.

Binary translation:
Divide a binary number into groups of 3 digits, starting from the right.
   If the last group contains less than 3 digits, add leading zeros.
   Then replace each group with the corresponding octal digit:
     - 000 = 0
     - 001 = 1
     - 010 = 2
     - 011 = 3
     - 100 = 4
     - 101 = 5
     - 110 = 6
     - 111 = 7
   Combine the resulting octal digits into one number and this will be the result.

Decimal translation:
   Divide the decimal number by 8.
   Write down the remainder of the division at the bottom.
   Divide the resulting quotient again by 8 and write down the new residuals at the bottom.
   Continue dividing by 8 and recording the remainder until the result of the division is 0.
   Reverse the remainder written at the bottom, and it will be an octal number.

Hexadecimal Translation:
First, convert a hexadecimal number to a binary number.
   Then convert the binary number to an octal number using the method described above for converting from binary to octal notation.
