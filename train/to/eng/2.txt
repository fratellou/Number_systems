In this system, only two digits are used - 0 and 1. It is used in computing.

Transfer from the binary system:
   This method is based on representing each digit of an eight-digit number as a three-digit binary combination. Below is the compliance table:
     Octal digit | Binary combination
     -----------------|-------------------
             0        |         000
             1        |         001
             2        |         010
             3        |         011
             4        |         100
             5        |         101
             6        |         110
             7        |         111
   To convert a number from an eight-digit system to a binary one, replace each digit of the eight-digit number with the corresponding three-digit binary combination.

Translation from the decimal system:
   This method is based on dividing a decimal number by 2 and writing the remainder, starting from the last remainder, until the result of the division becomes 0. And then the numbers are written in reverse order of the remainder.
   For example, to convert the number 10 to binary, follow these steps:
    - Divide the number 10 by 2: 10 รท 2 = 5, the remainder is 0
    - Divide the number 5 by 2: 5 รท 2 = 2, the remainder is 1
    - Divide the number 2 by 2: 2 รท 2 = 1, the remainder is 0
    - Divide the number 1 by 2: 1 รท 2 = 0, the remainder is 1
    - Write down the leftovers in reverse order: 1010
    
Translation from the hexadecimal system:
   This method is based on the representation of each character of a hexadecimal number in a four-digit binary combination. Below is the compliance table:
     Hexadecimal character | Binary combination
     ----------------------|-------------------
              0            |         0000
              1            |         0001
              2            |         0010
              3            |         0011
              4            |         0100
              5            |         0101
              6            |         0110
              7            |         0111
              8            |         1000
              9            |         1001
              A            |         1010
              B            |         1011
              C            |         1100
              D            |         1101
              E            |         1110
              F            |         1111
   To convert a number from hexadecimal to binary, replace each character of the hexadecimal number with the corresponding four-digit binary combination.

To convert a real number into a binary system, it is necessary to divide the number into integer and fractional parts. 
The whole part is converted to binary form by dividing by 2, and the fractional part is translated by multiplying by 2 and writing the whole part of the result. 
The resulting numbers are combined and represent the binary representation of a real number.
